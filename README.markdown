#GitHub News Feed Filter Chrome Extention

This will be an extention for Chrome that allows users to filter their news feed in github by category.  I noticed that my newsfeed is filled with comments and issues which I don't really care about, I just want to see the code.  This extention will make it easy to filter out comments and focus on code updates.

##Todo
* ~~Add close icon~~
* ~~Keep track of closed boxes so when a filter is unclicked the filtered items re-appears~~
* ~~Get more items when others are filtered out~~
   + ~~Get more items and only show the number that are hidden~~
   + ~~I think I need one big array that holds ALL the items, hidden and shown.~~
 * ~~Persist selected options~~
 * Use chrome's native API to check for More link click instead of timed loop
