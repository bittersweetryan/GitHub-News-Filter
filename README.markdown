#GitHub News Feed Filter Chrome Extention

This will be an extention for Chrome that allows users to filter their news feed in github by category.  I noticed that my newsfeed is filled with comments and issues which I don't really care about, I just want to see the code.  This extention will make it easy to filter out comments and focus on code updates.
